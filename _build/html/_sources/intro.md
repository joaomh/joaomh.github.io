# João Manoel Herrera Pinheiro
I bridge the gap between cutting-edge academic research and production-scale AI deployment. 

With a background as a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at University of São Paulo (USP) and over 5 years of experience in the banking and tech sectors, I specialize in building scalable Machine Learning and Data Engineering solutions.

In addition to my research and industry work, I’m an active science communicator. I produce educational content for my YouTube channel 2001 Engenharia: https://www.youtube.com/2001engenharia
