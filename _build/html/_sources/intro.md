# João Manoel Herrera Pinheiro
I bridge the gap between cutting-edge academic research and production-scale AI deployment. 

With a background as a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at University of São Paulo (USP) and over 5 years of experience in the banking and tech sectors, I specialize in building scalable Machine Learning and Data Engineering solutions.

In addition to my research and industry work, I’m an active science communicator. I produce educational content for my YouTube channel 2001 Engenharia: https://www.youtube.com/2001engenharia

# João Pinheiro
I hold a Master of Science (MSc) degree and am currently a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering, with a strong research focus on Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Biomedical Image Analysis, and Robotics. I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence professional with over five years of experience in the banking and technology sectors, specializing in Data Engineering and Machine Learning. My work focuses on transforming complex data into actionable insights and building scalable, high-impact solutions using technologies such as Python, Spark, AWS, and Databricks.

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning and Computer Vision Researcher at the University of São Paulo (USP), where I lead innovation-driven research projects with budgets exceeding USD 10 million and mentor students in applied AI research. I also teach undergraduate courses in Computer Vision and have supervised more than 30 students across academic and industry-oriented projects.

Beyond research and industry, I am an active science communicator. I produce educational content on my YouTube channel, 2001 Engenharia (https://www.youtube.com/2001engenharia
), and I am the author of An Introduction to Machine Learning, a free and open-source book available at https://joaomh.github.io/ml-book/intro.html
