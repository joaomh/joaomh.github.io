I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering(focus on Robotics, Machine Learning, AI, Computer Vision) at the University of São Paulo with a research project using machine learning techniques to assist surgeries.

I began my career as an intern at Itaú Unibanco, where I later became a Data Scientist. Currently, I work as a Data Engineer. In addition to my professional pursuits, I also manage a YouTube channel called '2001 Engenharia,' where I create programming videos.
