# João Pinheiro
I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering(focus on Robotics, Machine Learning, AI, Computer Vision) at the University of São Paulo with a research project using machine learning techniques to assist surgeries.

I began my career as an intern at Itaú Unibanco, where I later became a Data Scientist. Currently, I work as a Data Engineer. In addition to my professional pursuits, I also manage a YouTube channel called '2001 Engenharia,' where I create programming videos.

# Projects
Here I have some of my projects that I am working on or had worked on in the past.


# Current projects

## Books
### [An Introduction to Machine Learning](https://joaomh.github.io/ml-book/intro.html)
An online book built with Jupyter Book that covers the main topics in machine learning with projects.
### [An Introduction to Amazon Web Service](https://joaomh.github.io/aws-book/intro.html)
An online book built with Jupyter Book that covers the basics of AWS services and how to configure some of the products with projects.
## YouTube Channel 
### [2001 Engenharia](https://www.youtube.com/@2001Engenharia)
YouTube channel that aims to teach courses in programming, data science, machine learning and engineering.
