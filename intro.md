# João Pinheiro
I’m a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence professional with over 4 years of experience working across the banking and technology sectors, specializing in Data Engineering, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. I’m passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights and building scalable, high-impact solutions using technologies like Python, Spark, and AWS.

Currently, I’m a researcher in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the University of São Paulo (USP), where I lead innovation projects with budgets exceeding $10 million and mentor students on applied research. I also teach undergraduate courses in Computer Vision and have guided over 30 students in both academic and practical projects.

In addition to my research and industry work, I’m an active science communicator. I produce educational content for my YouTube channel 2001 Engenharia: https://www.youtube.com/2001engenharia
I'm the author of An Introduction to Machine Learning, a free and open-source book available here: https://joaomh.github.io/ml-book/intro.html

I'm always open to collaborations in AI, data-driven innovation, and science education.
